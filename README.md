# Simple Todo App
My to-do app is design to organize task as it is input by the user. The user enter a breid description of the task and the date they wish to complete it. The app put the task in a list format in order of submitted.

## Functionality

Aside from adding a task and a due date you can also check off the task and delete them at will. It also gives you a error message if the description is to short and needs to be longer for submital. It also has a checker to see if the date has past or not and it wont let you submit it otherwise.

## Technology

Some of the techniques used in this project is a FormValidator Javascript made to determine the outcome of the submit and checking the information. In that FormValidator Javascript each function is set up to handle all the functions of this app. These features include showing checking input validatiy and stopping submittal of the to-do task being submit if information is incorrect. 

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
